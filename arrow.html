	<h1>Oliver Queen/The Arrow</h1>
		<img src="oliver.jpg" alt="Oliver as himself and Oliver dressed in his green hooded vigilante suit.">
		<p>	Oliver Queen is a billionaire playboy turned vigilante archer.
			Five years before Oliver became the vigilante Arrow. He was stranded
			on a deserted island in the Northern China sea. He was lost and presumed
			dead for five years before he was discovered and brought back to Starling City.
			When he first came back, he was able to use his family's wealth to fund
			his vigilante cause. He used an old Queen Consolidated metal factory and turned
			it into a night club. The basement of his night club he used as his "Arrow Cave".
			In his first year back he stopped his best friend's father from destroying the city.
			After his best friend died in the earthquake, Oliver vowed never to kill again.
			In his second year back the police who were chasing him the year before started to
			help him out a little. Renaming Oliver from "The Hood" to "The Arrow". At the end
			of the year Slade Wilson/Deathstroke launched and assult on Starling City. Oliver 
			was only able to beat him with the help of his friends. At the end of his third year 
			Oliver was offered to become the next Ra's al Ghul. Oliver had a plan to kill himself 
			and Ra's by sabotaging the plane. Ra's was planning on releasing a bio-weapon on the city.
			Oliver's plan failed and he had an epic showdown with Ra's stabbing Ra's through the heart 
			with the same blade Ra's used to kill Oliver half a year earlier. Now Oliver has quit the 
			vigilante life and has moved somewhere far away with Felicity Smoak.
