		assistant and a former customer service member at Tech Village.
		Felicity is the daughter of Mr. Smoak, and Donna Smoak, a friend and former 
		employee of Walter Steele, the good friend of John Diggle, Roy Harper and the 
		late Sara Lance. She is also Oliver Queen's girlfriend. She was the primary 
		contact between the Arrow and Starling City Police Department Captain Quentin 
		Lance. She is also the employee and ex-girlfriend of Ray Palmer. Felicity is 
		very intelligent and extremely proficient with electronics, which is why both 
		Walter and Oliver initially approached her for help in their separate problems.
		After Oliver is shot by his mother, he retreats to Felicity's car, revealing his 
		identity to her and asking her to drive him to his warehouse instead of a 
		hospital. After she and Diggle save his life, she agrees to join his team, but 
		only until they find Walter. When Walter is found and rescued in "The Undertaking
		", Felicity decided to remain with the team. After spending time with them, 
		Felicity decided to become a permanent member of the team as the tech expert.
		After Oliver left the team, Felicity joined him and they went off to spend time 
		out of Starling City.</p>
