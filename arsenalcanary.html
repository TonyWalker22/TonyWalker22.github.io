	<h1>Roy Harper/Arsenal</h1>
	<img src="arsenal.jpg" alt="Roy Harper in his Arsenal suit">
	<p>	Roy Harper, is a street-savvy young man from the Glades. He is the son of the 
	late Roy Harper, Sr. and Mrs. Harper, the boyfriend of Thea Queen, a good friend of 
	Sin, a good friend and the current protégé of Oliver Queen, and the former protégé 
	and friend of the late Sara Lance. Roy was injected with the Mirakuru, becoming a 
	human weapon gaining a variety of powers including super-strength, endurance and 
	rapid cell regeneration. He was later cured by a counter-serum developed by S.T.A.R. 
	Labs. He became Oliver's sidekick and vigilante partner with the codename Arsenal up 
	until the point where he masqueraded as The Arrow and faked his death. Having no 
	choice, Roy left the team and Starling City to begin a new life under the name 
	Jason; whether he will maintain this name since leaving his job as a mechanic is 
	unknown.</p>
