  <p>ARTHUR:  Halt!  Hallo!  Hallo!</p>
  <p>GUARD:  'Allo!  Who is zis?</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round
      Table.  Who's castle is this?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  This is the castle of Our Master Ruiz' de lu la Ramper (sp?)</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God
      with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the
      night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen...
      Uh, he's already got one, you see?</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  What?</p>
  <p>GALAHAD:  He says they've already got one!</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Are you sure he's got one?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Oh, yes, it's very nice-a [To Other Guards]  I told him we already got one.</p>
  <p>OTHER GUARDS: [Laughing]</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Well, um, can we come up and have a look?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Of course not!  You are English types-a!</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Well, what are you then?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you
      silly king!</p>
  <p>GALAHAD:  What are you doing in England?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Mind your own business!</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle
      by force!</p>
  <p>GUARD:  You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your
      bottoms, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called
      Arthur-king, you and all your silly English kaniggets.  Thppppt!</p>
  <p>GALAHAD:  What a strange person.</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Now look here, my good man!</p>
  <p>GUARD:  I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty headed animal
      food trough whopper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother
      was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries.</p>
  <p>GALAHAD:  Is there someone else up there we could talk to?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a!</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.</p>
  <p>GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache.)
      wha?</p>
  <p>GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache!)
      [moo]</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--
      [twong]
      [mooooooo]
      Jesus Christ!
      Right!  Charge!</p>
  <p>ALL: Charge!</p>
      <p>[mayhem]</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Ah, this one is for your mother!</p>
      <p>[twong]</p>
  <p>ALL:  Run away!</p>
  <p>GUARD:  Thpppt!</p>
  <p>LAUNCELOT:  Fiends!  I'll tear them apart!</p>
  <p>ARTHUR:  No no, no.</p>
  <p>BEDEMIR:  Sir!  I have a plan, sir.</p>
